# 🔥 OmniRAG: Where AI Knowledge Gets Cooked to Perfection 🧠🍲

## 🍳 What's Cooking?

OmniRAG is not just another AI project - it's a full-course meal of intelligent knowledge retrieval and generation. We're brewing a special sauce of context-aware AI that's about to change how applications understand and generate information.

## 🥘 Ingredients in Our Knowledge Kitchen

- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**: Our secret spice
- **Modular Architecture**: Mix and match components like a chef
- **Multi-Domain Support**: From tech docs to creative writing
- **Scalable Design**: Serves knowledge at any scale

## 🧑‍🍳 Current Development Status

**Kitchen Status**: 🔥 Active Prototyping

- Initial RAG infrastructure
- Core application templates
- Documentation
- First public release

## 🍽️ Planned Applications

1. **Research Sous Chef**: Helping researchers digest complex information
2. **Code Cuisine Generator**: Cooking up clean, contextual code
3. **Creative Writing Bistro**: Generating stories with nuanced context
4. **Support Chatbot Café**: Serving personalized customer interactions

## 🥗 Quick Taste (Coming Soon)

```python
from omnirag import KnowledgeChef

# Instantiate your knowledge cooking station
chef = KnowledgeChef(domain='tech_docs')

# Generate a perfectly seasoned response
response = chef.cook_response(
    query="Explain RAG architecture",
    context_sources=['technical_papers', 'online_tutorials']
)

print(response.serve())  # Bon Appétit! 🍽️
```
